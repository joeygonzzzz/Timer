A good old fashioned timer!

Feel free to use this in your browser! The time is adjustable to fit your needs.

The outline of the timer is built using an svg tag in HTML. It wasn't something I had a lot of experince with, it was fun playing around with the dimensions to see what you can do with an svg tag!
